# ddas-frontend

DDAS (Dynamic Data Aggregation System) is a ___prototype___ serverless implementation (similar to AWS Lambda or Azure
functions) for data collection using different scripting languages. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple
and easy to use interface for collecting data from different sources and providing/storing their results for further
processing.
